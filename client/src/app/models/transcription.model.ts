 * Domain model for audio transcription.
 *
 * The model is deliberately two-layered:
 *  1. **Detected events are facts.** `DetectedNote` holds what the detector
 *     observed, timed in absolute seconds into the source audio. Nothing about
 *     tempo, meter, key or instrument can make it wrong.
 *  2. **A ScoreDoc is an interpretation of those facts.** Everything in
 *     `DerivationSettings` — tuning, capo, grid, confidence floor — is a knob
 *     on that interpretation, and `deriveScore` is pure, so a score can be
 *     re-derived at any time without re-running detection.
 *
 * `BeatGrid` sits on the interpretation side despite looking like measured
 * data; see its docblock.

 * nothing read it; a beat tracker that dropped or doubled a beat could have
 * filled it with downbeats the written bars disagreed with, and nothing would
